## Keynote: Debug your thinking

1: 21

- Single sparkler age 😂
- building on a foundation that wasn’t designed for the scale
- sales / product selling something before it is ready / poc work
- making the right architecture choices at the start
- doing everything right from the start - worry of running out of budget 
- you think you are doing everything right, but have you considered all the variables?
- no such thing as right architecture… no perfect language.. 
- what decisions have you made?
- what was impact?
- what negatives?
- what problems trying to solve?
- long term or short term?
- how many options considered?
- assumptions on context?
- how not overly bias on my “chosen” solution?
- how do I debug my thoughts?
- critical thinking 
- debug your thinking
- the trap: working in solution mode…
- ohh i have this problem, can you fix it for me…
- this is dangerous, bias into jumping into solution mode
- we are incentivised to jump into this. We need time to understand the problem.
- we might be trying to solve the wrong problem to begin with
- we need to slow down…
- is it actually a problem 
- people often bring us “a solution” 
- we must always dig deeper to try to understand what is going on
- always keep asking “why”
- 5 whys… 🙄
- use it for framing initial analysis 
- write it down 
- writing is natures way of telling you how sloppy your thinking is 😂😂😂
- got to make your thinking concise and clear
- framing problem:
- writing down
- avoid tech terms
- no solutions!
- make it measurable 
- then ask if this is the right problem
- the elevator problem 
- change from elevator is to slow, to, the wait time is to annoying
- added mirrors 😆😆😆 people stopped complaining
- reframing a problem
- we are here to solve business problems
- we should call out if there is a solution that involves no technical involvement at all
- ask:
- is this statement even true?
- who is affected by this?
- is there solution bias?
- what happened before this problem was occurring?
- hidden influences?
- sub optimal solution to the right problem is so much better than a perfect solution to the wrong problem 
- BIAS to speed JFDI
- why sql server used so much to store json 😂
- we are techies we want to use cool stuff
- children are naturally out of the box thinkers
- convergent and divergent thinking
- other people’s suggestions might be outside of our own box
- we feel safe in our own box of thinking
- curiosity over judgement
- hmm that’s an interesting idea, can you walk me though your thinking process on it?
- get different perspectives
- cognitive bias - it’s a feature not a bug 😂
- it give swift thinking - useful at times in real life
- but don’t need that quick reaction at work
- most common biases:
- false causality…. Are those events all connected?… 
- HIPPO effect.. highest paid persons opinion 😂😂
- authority bias
- confirmation bias
- assumption… something we believe so much we don’t even question it..
- why do I actually believe this?
- how to catch your biases:
- mindfulness… building Lego is mindful
- invite a devils advocate
- their job to involve in observing and catching the bias assumptions. Assign someone to the role and rotate it
- we want your feedback - rfc. Scale it big and you don’t have to wait for everyone. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
- take aways;
- slow down
- write it down
- work together and collaborate
-

## You Keep Using That Word: Asynchronous And Interprocess Comms

1: 13
![async](you-keep-using-that-word.jpg)

- boxes and arrows 😂
- meaning of words
- this talk is not about the boxes, but about the arrows
- microservice architecture 😂
- arrow =>dependancy
- some sort of logical dependancy
- EDA - it’s all about facts. Something has happened.
- an inversion to o request response model. There is the dependancy but it’s implemented the other way round
- don’t get stuck in the con game (v3)
- use term eventual convergence instead of eventual consistency 
- The reactive manifesto (2014 v2)
- problem with blocking calls - sum latency
- temporal decoupling
- intermediary between A and B eg message broker
- need to trust your broker
- stateless stateless stateless
- making requests idempotent makes retry’s safe
- SET - the word with the most meanings in the OED. 430 different meaning. RUN, will have 645 in next draft.
- derive meaning of a word from its context 
- “in the context and of this paper…..” context is important 😊
- socialtechnical systems

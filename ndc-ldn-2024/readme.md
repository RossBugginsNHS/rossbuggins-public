## Keynote: Debug your thinking

1: 21

- Single sparkler age 😂
- building on a foundation that wasn’t designed for the scale
- sales / product selling something before it is ready / poc work
- making the right architecture choices at the start
- doing everything right from the start - worry of running out of budget 
- you think you are doing everything right, but have you considered all the variables?
- no such thing as right architecture… no perfect language.. 
- what decisions have you made?
- what was impact?
- what negatives?
- what problems trying to solve?
- long term or short term?
- how many options considered?
- assumptions on context?
- how not overly bias on my “chosen” solution?
- how do I debug my thoughts?
- critical thinking 
- debug your thinking
- the trap: working in solution mode…
- ohh i have this problem, can you fix it for me…
- this is dangerous, bias into jumping into solution mode
- we are incentivised to jump into this. We need time to understand the problem.
- we might be trying to solve the wrong problem to begin with
- we need to slow down…
- is it actually a problem 
- people often bring us “a solution” 
- we must always dig deeper to try to understand what is going on
- always keep asking “why”
- 5 whys… 🙄
- use it for framing initial analysis 
- write it down 
- writing is natures way of telling you how sloppy your thinking is 😂😂😂
- got to make your thinking concise and clear
- framing problem:
- writing down
- avoid tech terms
- no solutions!
- make it measurable 
- then ask if this is the right problem
- the elevator problem 
- change from elevator is to slow, to, the wait time is to annoying
- added mirrors 😆😆😆 people stopped complaining
- reframing a problem
- we are here to solve business problems
- we should call out if there is a solution that involves no technical involvement at all
- ask:
- is this statement even true?
- who is affected by this?
- is there solution bias?
- what happened before this problem was occurring?
- hidden influences?
- sub optimal solution to the right problem is so much better than a perfect solution to the wrong problem 
- BIAS to speed JFDI
- why sql server used so much to store json 😂
- we are techies we want to use cool stuff
- children are naturally out of the box thinkers
- convergent and divergent thinking
- other people’s suggestions might be outside of our own box
- we feel safe in our own box of thinking
- curiosity over judgement
- hmm that’s an interesting idea, can you walk me though your thinking process on it?
- get different perspectives
- cognitive bias - it’s a feature not a bug 😂
- it give swift thinking - useful at times in real life
- but don’t need that quick reaction at work
- most common biases:
- false causality…. Are those events all connected?… 
- HIPPO effect.. highest paid persons opinion 😂😂
- authority bias
- confirmation bias
- assumption… something we believe so much we don’t even question it..
- why do I actually believe this?
- how to catch your biases:
- mindfulness… building Lego is mindful
- invite a devils advocate
- their job to involve in observing and catching the bias assumptions. Assign someone to the role and rotate it
- we want your feedback - rfc. Scale it big and you don’t have to wait for everyone. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
- take aways;
- slow down
- write it down
- work together and collaborate
-

## You Keep Using That Word: Asynchronous And Interprocess Comms

1: 13
![async](you-keep-using-that-word.jpg)

- boxes and arrows 😂
- meaning of words
- this talk is not about the boxes, but about the arrows
- microservice architecture 😂
- arrow =>dependancy
- some sort of logical dependancy
- EDA - it’s all about facts. Something has happened.
- an inversion to o request response model. There is the dependancy but it’s implemented the other way round
- don’t get stuck in the con game (v3)
- use term eventual convergence instead of eventual consistency 
- The reactive manifesto (2014 v2)
- problem with blocking calls - sum latency
- temporal decoupling
- intermediary between A and B eg message broker
- need to trust your broker
- stateless stateless stateless
- making requests idempotent makes retry’s safe
- SET - the word with the most meanings in the OED. 430 different meaning. RUN, will have 645 in next draft.
- derive meaning of a word from its context 
- “in the context and of this paper…..” context is important 😊
- socialtechnical systems 
- Tower of Babel old test

## Lunch

- does pressing lift buttons with a non body part increase chance of lift coming?
- is static from body just lighting up the button led?…

## Actionable Observability

1:8

- observability: understanding what is happening inside software systems to debug a problem, from telemetry emitted by system 
- utilising telemetry with goal of improving application reliability
- identify, debug, address tech issues
- incident management cycle
- role of automation.. reduce complexity, manage cognitive load
- collect ->identify->debug->….
- automate identity otherwise sat there looking at dashboards. Be proactive.
- infra metrics, service metrics, app metrics, user experience metrics
- define user journey, define metric, define thresholds. Eg:
- message send request submitted. => time to result of send received => a threshold…
- coming up with thresholds will often be iterative
- service level objectives:
- prioritise user journeys, focus on most important
- “North Star” metrics
- don’t let SLOs become overwhelmingly huge
- Service Level Indicator - reliability is different to availability. SLI should represent reliability. Eg very high latency could be counted equivalent to offline.
- setting error budget
- reliability 0-100% score
- alerting strategy:
- consumption of budget vs rate of change of budget (burn rate)
- automation not about replacing us, it’s about enabling us

## Architecture Modernization: Aligning Software, Strategy, and Structure

1:21 / 34

- nick tune- architecture modernisation - book
- ran the workshop sessions on ddd that JB attended 
- teams deploying multiple times a day
- need to see it early enough that you need to modernise
- open table stopped all features and modernised for 8 months… not always advocating that approach
- doing nothing- how long until irrelevant or fail?
- even if make good arch decisions, your assumptions your decisions are based on will change over time
- result: still end up with messy architecture…
- arch modernisation -> convert disadvantage to advantage
- talk overview:
- architecting for flow
- tools 
- kickstarting and enabling arch modernisation
- rewriting / using new tech, doesn’t fix all the problems. It’s deeper than that. It enables you to then be able to fix actual problem
- make changes / features fit inside one subdomain
- empower teams
- software decoupled
- always will have the question of should we do modernisation work or new feature work
- time to listen - indi young - book
- need the business objective to support the modernisation decisions
- impact mapping
- wardley mapping
- make decisions based on how component is evolving, not its current state
- ask how quickly each component is evolving
-  Event storming. Big picture and process modelling
- getting a true wide-perspective picture
- domains and subdomains
- grouping and transition points
- modernisation strategy selector..
- how to maximise roi on modernisation 
- platform modernisation and also,
- product, domain, software modernisation 
- codescene tool
- keeping momentum after event storming workshops
- architecture modernisation enabling team AMET. Don’t own a part of system, but help them achieve the change.
- team for range of skills not just arch’s.
- don’t get lost in all upfront planning
- make a decision on when first change will be seen. Aim a target of 3 - 6 months?
- patterns for migrations. Strangler fig. DDD bubble pattern. Danger of strangler fig.

## The definitive deep dive into the .git folder

1:13

- .git that folder is all you need
- objects - all git zlib compressed. Files created on commit. Files are named by hash of commit
- all the slides are on his GitHub 
- the commit reference another object id node
- tree node lists files and permissions 
- and is double zlib compressed
- the tree references blobs
- git cat-file
- git add puts the file in as a blob - it’s staged.
- the commit creates the commit object and links it to the blobs via tree object
- folders nested are represented by another tree node 
- git commit with -amend, this changed the file. But history is still stored.
- branches - refs folders
- git remotes can also be relative local file system paths…
- hooks folder, great for automation
- although hooks can’t be committed… so look at npm githooks which use symlinks
Git config files - alias section

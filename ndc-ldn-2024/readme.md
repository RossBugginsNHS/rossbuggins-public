## Keynote: Debug your thinking

> ### NDC Summary
> 
> There’s a myriad of complexity involved in building systems. However, two decades in software engineering taught me what truly makes or breaks a system: decisions. It’s not the programming language, the data store, the deployment model, or [insert your favorite tech here]. It’s about the decisions made and the ripple effects they cause. We spend endless hours trying to keep up with the latest and greatest in an industry that sprints faster than a caffeinated cheetah... But how much time was invested in questioning, improving, or, essentially, debugging our thinking process?
> 
> How do you structure your decisions, and how do they affect the software you build? When suboptimal decisions occur, do you reflect on the decision-making process itself? I've spent the last few years debugging my decision-making thought process, placing breakpoints to inspect which assumptions got me here and what alternatives I may have missed. As a result, my thought process became much more structured and streamlined, leading to better-balanced decisions. Join me in this session to explore how critical thinking can transform our decision-making process and elevate the quality of the solutions we build for our users.

### My Notes

1: 21

- Single sparkler age 😂
- building on a foundation that wasn’t designed for the scale
- sales / product selling something before it is ready / poc work
- making the right architecture choices at the start
- doing everything right from the start - worry of running out of budget 
- you think you are doing everything right, but have you considered all the variables?
- no such thing as right architecture… no perfect language.. 
- what decisions have you made?
- what was impact?
- what negatives?
- what problems trying to solve?
- long term or short term?
- how many options considered?
- assumptions on context?
- how not overly bias on my “chosen” solution?
- how do I debug my thoughts?
- critical thinking 
- debug your thinking
- the trap: working in solution mode…
- ohh i have this problem, can you fix it for me…
- this is dangerous, bias into jumping into solution mode
- we are incentivised to jump into this. We need time to understand the problem.
- we might be trying to solve the wrong problem to begin with
- we need to slow down…
- is it actually a problem 
- people often bring us “a solution” 
- we must always dig deeper to try to understand what is going on
- always keep asking “why”
- 5 whys… 🙄
- use it for framing initial analysis 
- write it down 
- writing is natures way of telling you how sloppy your thinking is 😂😂😂
- got to make your thinking concise and clear
- framing problem:
- writing down
- avoid tech terms
- no solutions!
- make it measurable 
- then ask if this is the right problem
- the elevator problem 
- change from elevator is to slow, to, the wait time is to annoying
- added mirrors 😆😆😆 people stopped complaining
- reframing a problem
- we are here to solve business problems
- we should call out if there is a solution that involves no technical involvement at all
- ask:
- is this statement even true?
- who is affected by this?
- is there solution bias?
- what happened before this problem was occurring?
- hidden influences?
- sub optimal solution to the right problem is so much better than a perfect solution to the wrong problem 
- BIAS to speed JFDI
- why sql server used so much to store json 😂
- we are techies we want to use cool stuff
- children are naturally out of the box thinkers
- convergent and divergent thinking
- other people’s suggestions might be outside of our own box
- we feel safe in our own box of thinking
- curiosity over judgement
- hmm that’s an interesting idea, can you walk me though your thinking process on it?
- get different perspectives
- cognitive bias - it’s a feature not a bug 😂
- it give swift thinking - useful at times in real life
- but don’t need that quick reaction at work
- most common biases:
- false causality…. Are those events all connected?… 
- HIPPO effect.. highest paid persons opinion 😂😂
- authority bias
- confirmation bias
- assumption… something we believe so much we don’t even question it..
- why do I actually believe this?
- how to catch your biases:
- mindfulness… building Lego is mindful
- invite a devils advocate
- their job to involve in observing and catching the bias assumptions. Assign someone to the role and rotate it
- we want your feedback - rfc. Scale it big and you don’t have to wait for everyone. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
- take aways;
- slow down
- write it down

## You Keep Using That Word: Asynchronous And Interprocess Comms

> ### NDC Summary
>
> You Keep Using That Word: Asynchronous And Interprocess Comms
>
> When it comes to distributed computing, one of the perennial topics comes down to how different services should communicate. Working out the relative merits of specific technical approaches can become a complex affair however, so we often reach for categorisation to simplify our work.
> 
> Sam Newman is interested in technology at the intersection of things, from development, to ops, to security, usability and organisations. After over a decade at ThoughtWorks he is now an independent consultant. Sam is the author of "Building Microservices" from O'Reilly. He has worked with a variety of companies in multiple domains around the world, often with one foot in the developer world, and another in the IT operations space. If you asked him what he does, he’d say ‘I work with people to build better software systems’. He has written articles, presented at conferences, and sporadically commits to open source projects. While Java used to be his bread and butter, he also spends time with Ruby, Python, Javascript, and Clojure, Infrastructure Automation and Cloud systems.

### My Notes
1: 13
![async](you-keep-using-that-word.jpg)

- boxes and arrows 😂
- meaning of words
- this talk is not about the boxes, but about the arrows
- microservice architecture 😂
- arrow =>dependancy
- some sort of logical dependancy
- EDA - it’s all about facts. Something has happened.
- an inversion to o request response model. There is the dependancy but it’s implemented the other way round
- don’t get stuck in the con game (v3)
- use term eventual convergence instead of eventual consistency 
- The reactive manifesto (2014 v2)
- problem with blocking calls - sum latency
- temporal decoupling
- intermediary between A and B eg message broker
- need to trust your broker
- stateless stateless stateless
- making requests idempotent makes retry’s safe
- SET - the word with the most meanings in the OED. 430 different meaning. RUN, will have 645 in next draft.
- derive meaning of a word from its context 
- “in the context and of this paper…..” context is important 😊
- socialtechnical systems 
- Tower of Babel old test 
- Sam Newman - building microservices, oreilly books

## Actionable Observability

> ### NDC Notes
>
> While observability is the first step towards building observable systems, monitoring enables us to action on the telemetry collected.
.
> Previous approaches to monitoring have relied primarily on infrastructure and service metrics, but modern approaches have embraced the idea of monitoring based on metrics that reflect the user experiences more accurately.
>
> This talk will elaborate on those differences and a new monitoring approach that actions on SLOs. We’ll cover the following:
> 1. Observability vs Monitoring
> 2. Metrics and Types of Metrics & Monitors
> 3. Why SLOs are a good monitoring strategy
> 
> Lesley Cordero is currently a Staff Software Engineer, Tech Lead at The New York Times. She has spent the majority of her career on edtech teams as an engineer, including Google for Education and other edtech startups.
>
> In her current role, she is focused on observability, shared platforms, and building excellent teams by setting reliability vision & strategy across The Times, improving our observability footprint, and cultivating culture that builds with the most vulnerable employees in mind first. She shows care for others by holding them accountable to the best versions of themselves – and by buying them the occasional bubble tea.

### My Notes
1:8

- observability: understanding what is happening inside software systems to debug a problem, from telemetry emitted by system 
- utilising telemetry with goal of improving application reliability
- identify, debug, address tech issues
- incident management cycle
- role of automation.. reduce complexity, manage cognitive load
- collect ->identify->debug->….
- automate identity otherwise sat there looking at dashboards. Be proactive.
- infra metrics, service metrics, app metrics, user experience metrics
- define user journey, define metric, define thresholds. Eg:
- message send request submitted. => time to result of send received => a threshold…
- coming up with thresholds will often be iterative
- service level objectives:
- prioritise user journeys, focus on most important
- “North Star” metrics
- don’t let SLOs become overwhelmingly huge
- Service Level Indicator - reliability is different to availability. SLI should represent reliability. Eg very high latency could be counted equivalent to offline.
- setting error budget
- reliability 0-100% score
- alerting strategy:
- consumption of budget vs rate of change of budget (burn rate)
- automation not about replacing us, it’s about enabling us

### My Notes

1:21 / 34

- nick tune- architecture modernisation - book
- ran the workshop sessions on ddd that JB attended 
- teams deploying multiple times a day
- need to see it early enough that you need to modernise
- open table stopped all features and modernised for 8 months… not always advocating that approach
- doing nothing- how long until irrelevant or fail?
- even if make good arch decisions, your assumptions your decisions are based on will change over time
- result: still end up with messy architecture…
- arch modernisation -> convert disadvantage to advantage
- talk overview:
- architecting for flow
- tools 
- kickstarting and enabling arch modernisation
- rewriting / using new tech, doesn’t fix all the problems. It’s deeper than that. It enables you to then be able to fix actual problem
- make changes / features fit inside one subdomain
- empower teams
- software decoupled
- always will have the question of should we do modernisation work or new feature work
- time to listen - indi young - book
- need the business objective to support the modernisation decisions
- impact mapping
- wardley mapping
- make decisions based on how component is evolving, not its current state
- ask how quickly each component is evolving
-  Event storming. Big picture and process modelling
- getting a true wide-perspective picture
- domains and subdomains
- grouping and transition points
- modernisation strategy selector..
- how to maximise roi on modernisation 
- platform modernisation and also,
- product, domain, software modernisation 
- codescene tool
- keeping momentum after event storming workshops
- architecture modernisation enabling team AMET. Don’t own a part of system, but help them achieve the change.
- team for range of skills not just arch’s.
- don’t get lost in all upfront planning
- make a decision on when first change will be seen. Aim a target of 3 - 6 months?
- patterns for migrations. Strangler fig. DDD bubble pattern. Danger of strangler fig.

### My Notes

1:13

- .git that folder is all you need
- objects - all git zlib compressed. Files created on commit. Files are named by hash of commit
- all the slides are on his GitHub 
- the commit reference another object id node
- tree node lists files and permissions 
- and is double zlib compressed
- the tree references blobs
- git cat-file
- git add puts the file in as a blob - it’s staged.
- the commit creates the commit object and links it to the blobs via tree object
- folders nested are represented by another tree node 
- git commit with -amend, this changed the file. But history is still stored.
- branches - refs folders
- git remotes can also be relative local file system paths…
- hooks folder, great for automation
- although hooks can’t be committed… so look at npm githooks which use symlinks
Git config files - alias section

## So You Want to Build An Event Driven System?

> ### NDC Notes
>
> So You Want to Build An Event Driven System?
> 
> Making your system 'event driven' is a common consideration when building modern systems. Especially if these applications leverage serverless technologies.
> 
> But what does that actually mean in the real world? What are the benefits of adopting this architecture style, what are the challenges and some of the tradeoffs?
> 
> In this session, you'll learn all about that and more with tips taken from building event driven systems in the real world. Starting from why, understanding what and plenty of practical things you can take away and use in your own applications. From the simple, through to some advanced integration patterns that this architecture style unlocks. to improve the resilience, extensibility and scalability of your systems.

### My Notes
1:21

- yuval Noah harari- sapiens - book:
- about stories being so important
- EDA is a communication pattern
- modelling the integration
- James Eastham - aws architect
- built EDA in the past, and many have failed
- learn more from failure than success
- example is that we are devs at plant based pizza, system currently request response.
- order processing have dependency on everything, kitchen, delivery etc
- aim for high cohesion, and low coupling 
- an appropriate level of coupling depends on the level of control you have over the endpoints.
- Martin fowlers talk on eda:
- what is eda - reversing dependencies 
- what is an event.. An immutable fact. Something that has happened in the past. It cannot be changed.
- event driven system vs event based system:
- eds- it’s driven by business events eg: PizzaBoxed, DeliveryNotificationSent.
- tell the story of your business through events
- events are first class citizens: events designed even before api.: Event First Design.
- notification event. Lightweight. Anaemic. Often leads to an api call to the sender. Can lead to fire, as far to many calls back to originator. The producer of events should be unaware of downstream consumers.
- event carried state transfer - a fat event. More in there for downstream consumers can use.
-  producer, consumer and event broker (bus, queue etc) - pub sub.
- always put a queue in front of compute. Eventbus ==>>> my domain (my queue => my compute). Protect your self from overload.
- go do event storming - to understand what the business events are 
- governance for controlling events… stop the unknowns breaking.
- put out a public RFC before changing.
-  payload. Split to data and meta. Meta should contain ids, event type, version. VERSION NUMBER. Depreciated flag? Sunset dates.
- fat vs sparse. Always - it depends.
- enriched pattern
- use eventual convergence over term eventual consistency. Embracing this is the EDA trade off.
- EDA dealing with http request response. Wrap events into a way to make call, and the publish event when finished, with a queue.
- meta data to contain trace ids. Previous event that triggered it.
- boundaries. Going to need request response somewhere at the edge. Really thin synchronous wrapper that dumps onto event bus - posts.
- but for gets.. separation of command events and queries. 
- processing commands synchronously. Eg send an email. 
- where should the responsibility lay. If truely event, eg email service listening to order created. Using queue for async commands.
- load on cqrs.
- transactional outbox pattern. Storing data in service before publishing it to the service.
- change data capture - stream output, publish events from the back of it. Using dynamodb streams. publish events.
- redid cache for query.


Question: integration event bus, fire and forget, or persistent and support event replay ability?

It depends on the use case. Does it need to get there? Then if persistent horizontal client scaling is hard. Or fifo queue. Ugh.

Question: how to deal with the common question of: now everything is dependant on a single event bus. Worry?




## Distribu-ready with the Modular Monolith

1:13
![micro mod](mono-micro.jpg)

https://ndclondon.com/agenda/distribu-ready-with-the-modular-monolith-0bk5/0tqfug96b0i


https://ndclondon.com/speakers/layla-porter



-  complexity is your enemy. Anyone can make something complicated. It’s hard to keep it simple.. Richard Branson
- monolith. Single executable. Some benefits. But problems. Simple deploy.
- hard to scale and maintain.
- microservice architecture. Divide into lots of small independently deployable services.
- what needs? Want to scale. What are options:
- go through code or infra and scale vertical / horizontal.
- or distributed system.
- the cost of distributed is simplicity.
- distro monolith is the worse place to be
- shared db is the evil of distro monoliths.
- DM: hard bits of complexity. But not of the independence benefits. None of the monolith ease of debug.
- DDD. Lose coupling and high cohesion.
- the more pleasant system to get there…
- the modular monolith.
- mono to modular mono (not distro mono) to microservice.
- the kitkat pattern.
- how to decompose the mono app.
- decomposing the database. Code first or db first. START db separation first. Then move onto code separation… 
- be pragmatic, not dogmatic.
- so…. The how?:
- how to ensure completely independent?
- how to communicate?:
- external not much change.
- internal inter proc comms:
- mediator pattern.
- messaging pattern.
- thin and fat content payloads
- how to enforce architecture… code review. 
- .net aspire https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/aspire/get-started/aspire-overview

Question: this focused on mono to micro. What happens if already in the distro mono hole?

A: pray 😂 communicate why it’s a problem. Need people to see why it’s a bad place to be.
 

## Better Code Reviews FTW!

1: 13

- why do code reviews? 
- finding defects least of concerns?
- it should focus on sharing knowledge and sharing patterns
- sharing knowledge
- shared ownership of code in the squad. 
- on merge it’s going from my code to our code
- how to do code reviews like a human
- be open for feedback
- appreciate what people do right, not brining down on the what they do wrong.
- award ties in discussions to the reviewer.! (The reviewer has a fresh set of eyes..) or at least consider this.
- review your own PR first
- have an absolute style guide.
- PR review should be a higher priority than anything else at all. Help someone to finishing something is better than starting something new.
- developers don’t have much patience. From a given list will pick the low hanging fruit and ignore the complex points
- regular little is the way forward. Through PR aim to get D grade code to C grade, not A grade. Next time it’s touched it can go from C to B/A. Or do a separate extra or to improve that.
- suggest code changes rather than just saying something is bad / wrong. Teach.
- framing feedback as questions
- if your arguing in code reviews, probably doing it wrong.
 

## How to get a grip on your microservices system using a service-mesh

- this is heavy on k8s
- what is service mesh and why use it
- observability
- chaos engineering
-  service mesh almost always use sidecar pattern
- ambient mesh coming soon, does it without another container
- sidecar runs alongside actual container, in the same pod
- istio as a mesh provider
- kiali very cool graph views ok k8s injections and traffic etc between them
- service mesh - power comes from mirroring requests to new versions of a service. Ie test a new version with real live data (obv any transactions etc have to be separate db etc)
- chaos engineering, injection faults, including network level style failures



## Let's build the worst Event Sourcing system!

1: 21/34

![worst es](worst-es.jpg)

- project franz 
- worst es system ever
- event store db
- Kafka for event storing or event bridge
- idempotency
- event ordering
- the queue we are standing in is always the slowest 😂
- Kafka topic and partition split. Topic is logical, partition is physical.
- event disordering 😂
- process managers. 
- the confusion between event sourcing and event streaming
- optimistic concurrency
- strong consistency
- Kafka can’t do the optimist concurrency
- basically don’t use Kafka for event sourcing.
- Kafka is good for what it should be used for.
- Kafka is for event streaming.
- event sourcing is about recording and storing business events.
- event streaming is about moving data from one place to another.
- cap theorem - consistency, availability, partitioning - can’t have all 3
- outbox pattern, store state and output message at same time. Both or neither
- CRAP theorem - managers wanting 100% of c an and p…
- passive aggressive events
- eg the bin is full, the dishwasher has finished 😂😂😂😂
- stream design. Event sourcing is still just storage.
- events on the inside and events on the outside.
- domain and integration events.
- important to have the distinction.
- keep granular events in your domain, in your domains own event store.
- long living streams. More events a stream, iops goes up
- snapshots. Every event? Some period of time? Every x events?
- hope driven design HDD
- snaps shots are a cache…
- closing the book. Eg rather than account, accounting month. Stream restarts each month.
- a bad system will beat a good person every time.
- fear uncertainty and doubt
- Peter principle
- running with an empty barrow


## It’s time to rebuild DevOps.

- breaking the mould
- may be a triggering talk for some 😂
- gene kim devops handbook, book
- Chris reed. Unless your pretty code is in production, you’re just wasting time.
- 2019 there were 80 devops days
- already 60 this year
- devops eating up the world 
- solving comms between devs and ops
- Etsy - infra / devops done well 
- key problems:
- paper cuts. All the little things that are a bit hard. Tool after tool to fix crap they comes before.
- collaboration. Pull requests / git, increase barriers to collaboration.
- source of truth. The actual infra, or the source control?…
- Rick Rubin. Book / quote. Average is nothing to aspire to.
- system initiative. Utilises digital twins.
- local stack

## How GitHub delivers GitHub using GitHub

13 / 21

- April Edwards
- been at GitHub for 11 months
- at ms before
- 3 week sprints. But it is set per feature team, vertical slices.
- at GitHub, all non tech staff use GitHub for their work, hr, sales, all of them 
- no local code
- all GitHub GitHub dev is using code spaces
- epics, stories, tasks
- epics mgmt quarterly 
- extensive use of feature flags
- docsets, collection of repos 
- code spaces 
- use of devcontainer for pre setting extensions for vs code workspaces
- 

## Keep your nose out of it. Denying yourself access to production

1: 5
- Glenn 
- why block yourself:
- blamability. You can’t touch it so can’t be blamed. Arse cover.
- criminal users at work
- criminal external
- limit attack surface
- explicit and auditable
- big shop Vs small shop, governance
- need to keep some agility. Deploying.
- zero trust. Assume breach.
- least privileged access
- application segmation, fits with microservices. Only have access to your part.
- azure managed identities, only can ever be assigned to a service.
- push logs out of prod that don’t have PII.
- just in time access
- azure PIM, request access for a set amount of time for certain resources, with reason specified and approval process.
- immutable ledgers for audit logs
- make a tool for it 😊
